    "## Basic Project Requirements (delete this markdown cell in your final submission)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this notebook**:  This notebook is the template for your semester project.  Each markdown cell provides instructions on what to do in order to complete a successful project.  The cell you're reading right now is the only one you can delete from what you eventually hand in.  For the other cells:\n",
    "1. You may replace the instructions in each cell with your own work but do not edit the cell titles (with the exception of the project title, above).  \n",
    "2. Follow the instructions in each section carefully.  For some sections you will enter only markdown text in the existing cells. For other sections, you'll accompany the markdown cells with additional code cells, and perhaps more markdown, before moving on to the next section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**.  You'll see point allocations listed in each of the section titles below.  In addition, there are other categories for points: \n",
    "1. Visualization (10 points).  Plots should be well organized, legible, labelled, and well-suited for the question they are being used to answer or explore.  \n",
    "2. Clarity (5 points). Note that clarity also supports points elsewhere, because if we can't understand what you're explaining, we'll assume you didn't understand what you were doing and give points accordingly!  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each Section or Category, we will give points according to the following percentage scale:\n",
    "1. More than 90%:  work that is free of anything but superficial mistakes, and demonstrates creativity and / or a very deep understanding of what you are doing.\n",
    "2. 80-90%: work without fundamental errors and demonstrates a basic understanding of what you're doing.\n",
    "3. 60-80%: work with fundamental flaws in the analysis and / or conveys that you do not understand the basics of the work you are trying to do.\n",
    "4. Below 60%: Work that is severely lacking or incomplete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we distinguish *mistakes* from *\"my idea didn't work\"*.  Sometimes you don't know if you can actually do the thing you're trying to do and as you dig in you find that you can't.  That doesn't necessarily mean you made a mistake; it might just mean you needed more information.  We'll still give high marks to ambitious projects that \"fail\" at their stated objective, as long as that objective was clear and you demonstrate an understanding of what you were doing and why it didn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of prediction questions:**  The number of prediction questions must be greater than or equal to the number of students in the team minus one.  (A 4 person team would need to explore 4-1 = 3 questions.)  Questions should be related, but have distinct work efforts, interpretation and analysis. An example: for land use regression, you could have a core prediction question (what is pollution concentration on a fine spatial scale), a supporting question that explore how the degree of spatial aggregation influences prediction quality, plus a prediction model that explores *temporal* prediction at one point in space.  There is a lot of flexibility here; if you have any doubt about whether your questions are distinct, consult with the instructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data requirements**:  Projects must use data from a minimum of $1+N_s$ different sources, where $N_s$ is the number of students in the group.  You should merge at least two data sets. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice on Project Topics**:  We want you to do a project that relates to energy and environment topics.  \n",

If you include nonlinear features in a regression model, why?). \n",

The training data set is what you use for cross-validation (i.e. you sample from within it to create folds, etc.).  The testing data set is held to the very end of your efforts, and used to compare qualitatively different models (e.g. OLS vs random forests).\n",

No model is perfect, and understanding a model's imperfections is extremely important for the purpose of knowing how to interpret your results.  Often, we know the model output is wrong but we can assign a direction for its bias.  This helps to understand whether or not your answers are conservative.  \n",
